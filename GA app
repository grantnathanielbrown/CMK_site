About two weeks ago, I was completing my final project for the part-time Web Development course that I completed with GA. On my website, I was utilizing an API to call information about Star Wars characters and display it to the user after they submitted a search query. I had two problems. First of all, the information was being shown in JSON, so I needed to find a way to display the information nicely. Second of all, I needed to make the website visually interesting.

I just finished my degree at NYU and I am looking to expand my skill set, so I am going to be devoting all of my energy into this course. Besides the time spent commuting, I will be spending all of my weekday hours on this course. I do not have a part-time job or any other commitments.



Dear Margaret and Mark,
